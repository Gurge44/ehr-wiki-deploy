## üìù Text Instructions

### Step 1: Extract the ZIP

Once downloaded, open the ZIP file. You should see a structure like this:

<FileTree>

- EHR
  - dotnet
    - ‚Ä¶ runtime files
  - BepInEx
    - plugins
      - Mini.RegionInstall.dll
      - EHR.dll
    - ‚Ä¶
  - winhttp.dll
  - steam_appid.txt  
  - doorstop_config.ini
  - changelog.txt  
  - .doorstop_version

</FileTree>

---

### Step 2: Move the Files

Move all files to your **Among Us game folder**:

- **Steam**  
  Right-click Among Us in your Library ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Browse Local Files  
  Typical game folder path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Among Us\`

- **Epic Games**  
  Typical game folder path: `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\AmongUs\`

- **Microsoft Store**  
  Usually found in `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\...` (varies by system)

**Optional (Steam only):**  
You can create a new folder and copy both your game files and the mod files there if you want to keep things separate.

---

### Step 3: Launch the Game

:::danger[Epic Games Launch Warning]
**Important for Epic Games users:**  
Do not run `Among Us.exe` directly from the game folder. Doing so will cause an authentication failure.  
Always launch the game through the **Epic Games Launcher** or by clicking the **desktop shortcut** created during installation.
:::

For Steam and Microsoft Store users, double-click `Among Us.exe` inside the folder where you installed the mod.  
If everything is set up correctly, the modded game will start and **EHR** will initialize.

Once you've launched the game at least once, your directory will look like this:

<FileTree>

- EHR
  - Among‚ÄÉUs_Data
    - ‚Ä¶
  - BepInEx
    - plugins
      - EHR.dll
      - Mini.RegionInstall.dll
    - ‚Ä¶
  - dotnet
    - ‚Ä¶ runtime files
  - EHR_DATA
    - Achievements.json
    - BanList.txt
    - BanWords.txt
    - DenyName.txt
    - Moderators.txt
    - tags.txt
    - template.txt             
    - VIPs.txt
    - WhiteList.txt
  - Language
    - template.txt    
  - .doorstop_version
  - **Among‚ÄÉUs.exe** ‚û§ Launch the game using this executable
  - doorstop_config.ini
  - **steam_appid.txt** ‚û§ Only present in the Steam version
  - winhttp.dll 
  - ‚Ä¶

</FileTree>

:::note
The `EHR_DATA` folder and its contents will only be generated after you launch the game for the first time with the mod installed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### The mod isn‚Äôt loading?

Here‚Äôs a quick checklist:
- [x] Write the press release
- [x] Using Among Us **v16.0.5**?
- [x] Installed into the **correct folder**?
- [x] **Antivirus** didn‚Äôt delete anything?
- [x] This log files exists?
  - `BepInEx/log.html`

If the logs are missing, the mod probably didn‚Äôt start at all.

### SteamworksAuthFail / Epic Account ID Error?

#### If you're on Steam:

- Make sure **Steam** is running before launching the game.
- Ensure `steam_appid.txt` exists in your Among Us folder and contains:

```sh
945360
```
#### If you're on Epic:

- Make sure you're **launching the game from the Epic Games Launcher directly** or its **desktop shortcut**.
  Starting `Among Us.exe` in the mod folder does **not** work.

- Some devices that are **very old** or have a **weak internet connection** may always encounter this error.
