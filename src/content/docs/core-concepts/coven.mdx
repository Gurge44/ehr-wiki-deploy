## 🔮 Coven Roles

The **Coven** is a faction inspired by *Town of Salem*.  
Once feared and hunted by townsfolk, these witches and sorceresses have now taken root aboard the Crewmates’ ship — plotting a takeover from within.

Coven members work as a **separate team**, each with magical powers that become more dangerous after they unlock the legendary *Necronomicon*.

> 📖 After a **certain number of meetings** *(set by the host)*, a Coven member will receive the **Necronomicon**, which greatly enhances their abilities.

## 🏆 Win Conditions

The Coven wins when they **outnumber or eliminate** all non-Coven players.  
Some roles may provide alternate win paths based on hexes, potions, or souls.

---

## ⚙ Shared Traits

- Coven roles are part of their **own team** (not Crewmate or Impostor).
- They can **see other Coven members** during the game.
- The **Coven Leader always spawns** if the faction is enabled.
- The **Necronomicon** grants enhanced powers after three meetings (unless noted otherwise).
- Some Coven roles **cannot kill directly** until they receive the Necronomicon.

---

## 🔧 Customization Tips

- Enable **only a few Coven roles** to maintain game balance.
- Consider adjusting “Number of Coven” and Necronomicon delay to match lobby size.
- Some roles like **Warlock** and **Ritualist** do not benefit from the Necronomicon — balance them with stronger allies.
- Avoid mixing Coven with Impostors unless you want chaotic, faction-heavy games.

> ✨ A properly coordinated Coven can quietly take over before anyone realizes they’re under a spell.
