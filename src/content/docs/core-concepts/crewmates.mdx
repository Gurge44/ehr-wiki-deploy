## 👷🏻‍♂️ What are Crewmate Roles?

Crewmates are the **core team** in Among Us.  
Their main goal is to complete tasks or identify and eject all threats. EHR adds a wide variety of unique crewmate roles to help accomplish this, each with their own abilities and specialties.

## 🏆 Win Conditions

All crewmate roles share the same win condition:  
**Eliminate all Impostors (and hostile Neutrals) or finish all tasks.**

Some supporting notes:

- Crewmates win **as a team** — even if they die.
- Tasks must be completed to pressure hostile roles and help win.
- Some crewmates can aid by providing info, protection, or disruption.

## 🔧 Customization Tips
