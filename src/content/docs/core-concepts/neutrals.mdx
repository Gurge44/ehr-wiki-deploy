## 🎲 What are Neutral Roles?

Neutral roles are **not aligned** with Crewmates or Impostors.  
They operate independently and have unique objectives, which can range from survival to chaos. Make sure to read the role descriptions for neutral roles carefully.

## 🏆 Win Conditions

Each neutral role has its own condition for winning.  
Most common win conditions include:

- Survive until the end of the game.
- Be killed under specific circumstances.
- Win if a certain team/role loses.
- Be the last player alive
- Cause confusion or sabotage both teams.

:::note 
Some neutral roles can win **alongside** either team if their condition is met.
