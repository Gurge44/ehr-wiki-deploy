In Bed Wars, teams compete to protect their bed while eliminating other teams. Understanding the objective is crucial for success.

## Team Setup

* Players are divided into teams, each with one bed.
* As long as your bed is intact, you will respawn a few seconds after being killed.
* Once your bed is destroyed, your team will no longer respawn after dying.
* The last remaining team wins the game.

## Key Notes

* Always know the location of your bed and other teams’ beds.
* Protect your bed with layers of blocks to prevent easy destruction.
* Prioritize targeting teams that have weaker defenses to gain an advantage.
