:::caution
Scroll down to the **Assets** section of the release.

* `EHR_Steam.zip`

This avoids common setup issues.

## 📝 Text Instructions

### Step 1: Extract the ZIP

Once downloaded, open the ZIP file. You should see a structure like this:

<FileTree>
  * EHR
    * dotnet
      * … runtime files
    * BepInEx
      * plugins
        * Mini.RegionInstall.dll
        * EHR.dll
      * …
    * winhttp.dll
    * **steam_appid.txt** ➤ Only present in the Steam version
    * doorstop_config.ini
    * changelog.txt
    * .doorstop_version
</FileTree>

---

### Step 2: Move the Files

Move all files to your **Among Us game folder**:

* **Steam**\
  Right-click Among Us in your Library → Manage → Browse Local Files\
  Typical game folder path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Among Us\`

* **Epic Games**\
  Typical game folder path: `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\AmongUs\`

* **Microsoft Store**\
  Usually found in `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\...` (varies by system)

**Optional (Steam only):**\
You can create a new folder and copy both your game files and the mod files there if you want to keep things separate.

---

### Step 3: Launch the Game

:::danger[Epic Games Launch Warning]
**Important for Epic Games users:**\
Do not run `Among Us.exe` directly from the game folder. Doing so will cause an authentication failure.\
Always launch the game through the **Epic Games Launcher** or by clicking the **desktop shortcut** created during installation.
:::

For Steam and Microsoft Store users, double-click `Among Us.exe` inside the folder where you installed the mod.\
If everything is set up correctly, the modded game will start and **EHR** will initialize.

Once you've launched the game at least once, your directory will look like this:

<FileTree>
  * EHR
    * Among Us_Data
      * …
    * BepInEx
      * plugins
        * EHR.dll
        * Mini.RegionInstall.dll
      * …
    * dotnet
      * … runtime files
    * EHR_DATA
      * Achievements.json
      * BanList.txt
      * BanWords.txt
      * DenyName.txt
      * Moderators.txt
      * tags.txt
      * template.txt
      * VIPs.txt
      * WhiteList.txt
    * Language
      * template.txt
    * .doorstop_version
    * **Among Us.exe** ➤ Launch the game using this executable (On Steam)
    * doorstop_config.ini
    * **steam_appid.txt** ➤ Only present in the Steam version
    * winhttp.dll
    * …
</FileTree>

:::note
The `EHR_DATA` folder and its contents will only be generated after you launch the game for the first time with the mod installed.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### The mod isn’t loading?

Here’s a quick checklist:

* [x] Using Among Us **v17.0.1**?
* [x] Installed into the **correct folder**?
* [x] **Antivirus** didn’t delete anything?
* [x] This log file exists?
  * `BepInEx/log.html`

If the logs are missing, the mod probably didn’t start at all.

:::note[Linux Users using Wine/Proton]
Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/proton_wine.html) to configure Wine/Proton to load the winhttp.dll file properly.
:::

:::caution
The game can take several minutes to start on the **first launch after installation**.\
**Do not close the game using Task Manager**. Doing so will reset all progress. Just wait patiently.

### SteamworksAuthFail / Epic Account ID Error?

#### If you're on Steam:

* Make sure **Steam** is running before launching the game.
* Ensure `steam_appid.txt` exists in your Among Us folder and contains:

```sh
945360
```

#### If you're on Epic:

* Make sure you're **launching the game from the Epic Games Launcher directly** or its **desktop shortcut**.
  Starting `Among Us.exe` in the mod folder does **not** work.

* Some devices that are **very old** or have a **weak internet connection** may always encounter this error.\
  In that case, contact [Innersloth Support](https://innersloth.zendesk.com).
