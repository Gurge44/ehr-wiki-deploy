Mingle in **Endless Host Roles** is a fast-paced survival gamemode inspired by Squid Game style room challenges.\
This mode focuses on movement, room requirements, and quick decision making.\
Each round assigns a set of rooms, and every room requires a specific number of players.\
Your goal is to reach the correct room with the correct number of players before the timer expires.\
If you enter the wrong room, or the room has too many or too few players, you are eliminated.\
Rounds continue with new rooms, changing requirements, and shorter timers until only one player remains.
