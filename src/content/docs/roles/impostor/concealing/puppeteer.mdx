**Faction:** Impostor\
**Alignment:** Concealing\
**Basis:** Impostor

As the Puppeteer, you can use your kill button to manipulate another player. This player will become *puppeted*. After a configurable amount of time, the *puppeted* player will become *manipulated* and kill any player that enters their killing range **except** players with the Lazy Guy role, players with the Lazy addon, or other Impostors, including the Puppeteer themself (unless configured otherwise).

A layer of difficulty can be added to the role by configuring a lower maximum number of puppets the Puppeteer can make, or having the Puppeteer die after using all of their allocated puppet abilities. There is also an option to have the *puppeted* player die with their victim. 

## Options

- ### Max
  **Type:** `number`

  The cap for how many of this role can spawn.

- ### Puppet Cooldown
  **Type:** `time (2.5s - 60s)`

  The amount of time after the start of each round until the Puppeteer can use their puppet ability.

- ### Can Kill Normally
  **Type:** `yes/no`

  Whether the Puppeteer can kill normally. If this is enabled, the Puppeteer should press the kill button twice to perform a kill.
    
    - #### Puppeteer Kill Cooldown
      **Type:** `time (2.5s - 60s)`

      If *Can Kill Normally* is enabled, the amount of time after the start of each round until the Puppeteer can perform a kill.

- ### Minimum Delay Before The Puppeted Player Can Kill
  **Type:** `time (0s - 90s)`

  The minimum delay before the *puppeted* player becomes *manipulated* and able to kill anyone who enters their range. This should never be lower than the maximum delay.

- ### Maximum Delay Before The Puppeted Player Can Kill
  **Type:** `time (0s - 90s)`

  The maximum delay before the *puppeted* player becomes *manipulated* and able to kill anyone who enters their range. This should never be lower than the minimum delay.

- ### Manipulation Ends After a Specific Time
  **Type:** `yes/no`

  Whether the *puppeted* player is *manipulated* indefinitely or there is a time limit. If enabled, after this time has elapsed, the *puppeted* player will return to normal.
  

  - #### Time After The Manipulation Ends
    **Type:** `time (0s - 90s)`

    The amount of time until the *manipulated* player loses the effect.
  <Aside>
    This timer specifically starts after the **manipulation** starts, not the inital puppeting.
  </Aside>

- ### Bypass Lazy
  **Type:** `yes/no`

  If enabled, the players with the Lazy addon will be able to be *puppeted*. By default, players with the Lazy addon are immune to being *puppeted*.

- ### Bypass Lazy Guy
  **Type:** `yes/no`

  If enabled, Crewmates with the Lazy Guy role will be able to be *puppeted*. By default, Crewmates with the Lazy Guy role are immune to being *puppeted*.

- ### Puppet Can Kill Other Impostors
  **Type:** `yes/no`

  If enabled, the *puppeted* player will be able to kill other impostors - not the Puppeteer.

- ### Puppet Can Kill The Puppeteer
  **Type:** `yes/no`

  If enabled, the *puppeted* player will be able to kill the Puppeteer who puppeted them.
  <Aside type="caution">
  Combining this with a very low [Minimum Delay Before The Puppeted Player Can Kill](#minimum-delay-before-the-puppeted-player-can-kill) (0-2 seconds) can be quite harsh on the Puppeteer, as the puppet has the chance to kill them almost instantly!
  </Aside>

- ### Maximum Number of Puppets
  **Type:** `number (0 - 30)`

  The maximum number of times the Puppeteer can puppet. This only counts successful puppets and does not reset after meetings.

- ### Puppeteer Dies After Running Out Of Puppets
  **Type:** `yes/no`

  If enabled, the Puppeteer will suicide after using their last puppet. This only counts successful puppets.

- ### Puppet Dies Along With The Victim
  **Type:** `yes/no`

  If enabled, the *puppeted* player will die with the player they kill when manipulated.
