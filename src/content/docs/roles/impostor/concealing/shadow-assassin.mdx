The Shadow Assassin is a deadly impostor variant with enhanced stealth capabilities. When activated, the Shadow Assassin can become nearly invisible for a short duration, allowing them to move through the ship undetected and strike at opportune moments.

This role excels at ambush tactics and creating chaos among the crew. The Shadow Assassin's ability has a cooldown period, requiring strategic timing to maximize effectiveness. Crewmates may notice subtle visual distortions when the Shadow Assassin is nearby, adding a layer of psychological tension to the game.

The role rewards patient, tactical gameplay and punishes reckless aggression. Master assassins know when to strike and when to blend in with the crew.

## Role Mechanics
### Invisibility System

When the Shadow Assassin activates their ability, they enter a **shadow mode** that makes them nearly invisible to other players. During this time:

- Movement speed remains normal
- Kill cooldown is reduced by the configured multiplier
- Players within detection range see subtle visual distortions
- The ability automatically deactivates after the duration expires

### Detection Mechanics

Crewmates can detect the Shadow Assassin through:
- Visual distortions when within the configured range
- Audio cues when the assassin moves nearby
- Emergency lights revealing the shadow outline

## Strategy Tips

- **Timing is Everything**: Use your shadow ability strategically near groups to create confusion
- **Isolate Targets**: Time your strikes when other players are spread out
- **Cooldown Management**: Avoid using shadow mode unnecessarily to keep your cooldown available
- **Task Awareness**: Pay attention to task completion rates to identify safe targets
- **Vent Positioning**: Position yourself near vents for quick escapes after kills

## Counterplay 
Crewmates can counter the Shadow Assassin by:

- **Buddy System**: Staying in groups to reduce isolation opportunities
- **Watch for Distortions**: Being alert for visual effects that indicate nearby shadow mode
- **Quick Meetings**: Calling emergency meetings when suspicious activity is detected
- **Visual Tasks**: Prioritizing visual tasks to establish innocence early
- **Light Management**: Fixing lights immediately to reduce shadow effectiveness

<Aside type="danger" title="Important Notes">
**Balance Considerations**: This role can be extremely powerful with low cooldowns. Server hosts should test settings carefully to ensure fair gameplay.

**Performance Impact**: Shadow effects may cause lag on lower-end devices. Consider disabling visual distortions if players report performance issues.
