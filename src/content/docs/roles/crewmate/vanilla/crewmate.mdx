## Description

The vanilla crewmate is not modified by Endless Host Roles. Every player will become a crewmate by default if no other roles are given a chance of being selected. 

## Options

- ### `Max`
The maximum number of this role that will be selected to be in the next game. *However*, uniquely for vanilla crewmates, if there are not enough other roles selected, this max limit will be bypassed.
