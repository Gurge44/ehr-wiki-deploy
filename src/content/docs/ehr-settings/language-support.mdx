## 🌐 What Can You Customize?

The EHR Mod supports full text customization using editable language files. You can override **role names**, **system messages**, **role descriptions**, and practically anything text-based in the mod.

This guide walks you through setting up your own custom translations.

---

## 📂 Step-by-Step Guide

### 1️⃣ Locate Your Game Directory

Depending on your platform:

- **Steam:**
  ```
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Among Us
  ```

- **Epic Games:**
  ```
  C:\Program Files\AmongUs
  ```

- **Microsoft Store:**
  ```
  C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\InnerSloth.LLC-AmongUs_8wekyb3d8bbwe
  ```

---

### 2️⃣ Open the `Language` Folder

If it doesn't exist, just launch the game once to generate it automatically.

```
[Among Us Folder]/Language/
```

---

### 3️⃣ Clone the `template.dat` File

Make a copy of `template.dat` to preserve the original.

---

### 4️⃣ Rename the File

Rename your copy to match your in-game language, for example:

```
English.dat
```

Other examples:
- `Spanish.dat`
- `German.dat`

> ✅ The name **must match the language set in-game**.

---

### 5️⃣ Customize the Translations

Open the `.dat` file with a plain text editor like **Notepad** or **VS Code**.

Each line follows this format:

```
KEY: Custom Translation
```

Example:
```
ROLE_JESTER: Joker
```

- You can delete lines you don’t want to override.
- Only lines with changed translations need to stay in the file.

---

### 6️⃣ Reload Translations In-Game

If the game is already running:

- Press `F5 + T` to reload translations

Or just **restart the game** to apply your custom localization.

---

## 🔍 Finding Translation Keys

The complete list of default strings and their keys can be found in the official language file:

> 📄 [`Resources/Lang/en_US.json`](https://github.com/Gurge44/EndlessHostRoles/blob/main/Resources/Lang/en_US.json)

You can search this file by role, message, or section.

:::tip[Pro Tips]
- Keep your `.dat` files backed up in case of mod updates.
- If you want to create a full new language, you can translate the entire file.
- Ask the community in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/m2qS2WCDuv) if you're unsure about a specific key.
