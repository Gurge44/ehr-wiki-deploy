EHR Mod offers several client-side settings that change how the game behaves, looks, and sounds — only for you. These are accessible from the ⚙️ **gear icon** in the main menu and do not affect other players or the host lobby.

:::note
These options **only affect your game client** and do not interfere with gameplay mechanics, roles, or settings in the lobby unless explicitly stated.
