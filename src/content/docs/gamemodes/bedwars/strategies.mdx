## Early Game Strategy

- Quickly collect **Iron and Gold** from base generators  
- Build **2-3 layers** of basic defense around your bed using **Wool or Wood**  
- Purchase starter gear like **swords, armor, and blocks**  
- Assign one teammate to defend while others gather resources  

**Recommended Bed Layers:** Wool → Wood or Wood → Wood

---

## Mid Game Strategy

- Upgrade existing outer layers to stronger materials (**Stone or End Stone**) instead of adding too many new layers  
- Control premium resource generators (**Diamonds and Emeralds**) to gain team-wide upgrades  
- Assign roles: defenders, collectors, and attackers  
- Upgrade tools and armor regularly for faster bed breaking and better combat  

**Recommended Bed Layers:** Keep 2-3 layers but upgrade outer layers to Stone or End Stone

---

## Late Game Strategy

- Use **Obsidian** as the outermost layer for maximum protection  
- Keep defenses compact by upgrading rather than adding unnecessary layers  
- Coordinate team attacks on enemy beds while maintaining your own defenses  
- Use potions, traps, and movement tools to gain advantages during pushes  

**Recommended Bed Layers:** Wool/Wood (inner) → Stone (middle) → Obsidian (outer)

## Counter-Strategy Planning

### Shears
Wool and other very soft materials are broken extremely quickly, so avoid using them as outer layers.  

### Pickaxes
Pickaxes can break most layers quickly, especially Stone and Wood. To counter this effectively:
- Use **Reinforced Armor** to reduce damage your team takes during attacks.  
- Invest in **Traps** to slow down or alert you when enemies enter your base.  
- Apply **Sharpness upgrade** to respond faster and fight off intruders.  
- Coordinate defenders to protect key areas, ensuring pickaxe users are contested before reaching your bed.  

### TNT
Explosives are blocked by materials like Obsidian or Glass as outer layers, protecting inner layers.  

### Rush Attacks
Fast melee pushes can overwhelm unprepared teams. To counter effectively:
- Use **Trap upgrades** to slow or blind rushing players when they enter your base.  
- Use **Reinforced Armor and Sharpness** to maximize damage and survivability.  
- Utilize **movement tools and utilities** like Ender Pearls or Speed Potions to reposition quickly and block rushers.  
- Layer defenses strategically so that even a single player can stall multiple attackers until help arrives.

## Summary Tips

- Always **protect your bed** before going on the attack  
- Collect resources continuously; upgrades win games  
- Communicate and assign team roles for efficiency  
- Upgrade layers strategically instead of overbuilding  
- Adapt strategies based on enemy tools and aggression
