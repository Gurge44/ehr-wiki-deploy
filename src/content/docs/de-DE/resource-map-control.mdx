## Map Control During Grace Period

During the grace period, players are **confined to their base** and cannot explore the map. This gives teams time to:

* Build bed defenses using base Iron and Gold generators
* Purchase basic equipment and armor
* Plan their post-grace strategy

### Resources

These are the main resources you collect from generators.

* **<font color="#ffffff">▲ Iron</font>**\
  Basic resource used for cheap blocks and starter gear

* **<font color="#ffff00">⬤ Gold</font>**\
  Stronger currency for better weapons, armor, and tools

* **<font color="#00b0f0">◆ Diamond</font>**\
  Used mainly for **team upgrades** such as traps, haste, heal pool, sharpness, and protection

* **<font color="#178530">◈ Emerald</font>**\
  Rare resource for powerful late-game items like obsidian, potions, and utilities

:::tip
**Base resources** (Iron and Gold) are available from the start and focus on early game survival and bed defense.\
**Premium resources** (Diamond and Emerald) spawn after the grace period and are essential for advanced upgrades and late-game strategies. Controlling these gives a major advantage.

## Map Control After Grace Period

Once the grace period ends, movement restrictions lift and teams rush to control premium generators.

**Example – Skeld Map**:

* 3 Diamond Generators (contested locations)
* 1 Emerald Generator (most valuable, heavily fought over)

### Why Premium Resources Matter

* **Limited Supply**: Few generators means intense competition

* **High Value**: Diamond and Emerald equipment provides significant advantages

* **Strategic Control**: Holding these generators often determines match outcomes

* Emerald generators are especially contested due to their extreme scarcity and value

* Teams must balance base defense with resource acquisition

* Premium generators become natural battlegrounds

* Early control of these locations provides lasting advantages
