## Player Inventory

Each player has an **inventory** to manage their items.

### Display

Inventory slots are displayed like this:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │   
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Or with slot numbers for clarity:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ▐【 1 】▐【 2 】│【 3 】│【 4 】│【 5 】│【 6 】│【 7 】│【 8 】│【 9 】│
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

* Each empty box `(│ │)` is one **inventory slot**
* The first slot is currently **selected**
* The selection is shown by the **bold white bars** `▐ ▐` around the first slot
* When a slot is selected, the item inside it is the one you are actively holding or using

### Example

(Attachments TBA)

* Slot【1】is active in this example
* If you have a pickaxe in that slot, pressing the **Pet button** will start breaking the bed
* If you have blocks in that slot, pressing the **Pet button** will place them on your bed

---

### Switching Slots

* Use the **Vanish button** to move to the next slot
* You can also type the **number of the slot** in chat (example: typing `5`) to instantly select that item

---
