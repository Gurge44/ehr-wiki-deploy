## 🔪 What are Impostor Roles?

Impostors are the **main opposing team** to the Crewmates.\
Their goal is to sabotage the ship and eliminate players without being caught. EHR expands the impostor team with custom roles, each bringing new strategies to deception and elimination.

## 🏆 Win Conditions

Impostors win when **they equal or outnumber** all remaining non-impostors.\
This includes:

* Killing or ejecting enough players to prevent being overruled.
* Exploiting sabotage (like Reactor or Oxygen) to cause a win.
* Some impostor roles may have **special alternate win conditions**.

---

## ⚙ Shared Traits

* Impostor roles can **sabotage systems**, **vent**, and **kill** by default.
* Appear as friendly to each other (can see each other’s names).
* Impostors are **not revealed** on death unless settings change it.
* Some roles may **disable kill**, instead focusing on support or confusion.
* Most impostor roles are **disabled by default** to avoid overpowering.

---

## 🔧 Customization Tips

* Only enable a few impostor roles per game for balance.
* Pair killing roles with support roles like Occultist or Ventriloquist for synergy.
* Avoid stacking too many information blockers or chaos-makers in one match.

> 💀 A deceptive team with the right blend of abilities can overwhelm even the best crews.
