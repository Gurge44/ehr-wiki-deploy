Bed Wars matches progress through several phases. Understanding each phase helps with planning your strategy.

## Phase 1: Grace Period

* A short grace period occurs at the start of the game.
* Attacking is disabled and leaving your base is not allowed.
* Use this time to collect resources, check your inventory, and build basic defenses around your bed.

## Phase 2: Resource Gathering

* Bases and map points generate resources:
  * **Iron and Gold**: used for blocks and basic gear
  * **Diamonds**: used for team upgrades like traps, haste, heal pool, and sharpness
  * **Emeralds**: rare currency for strong items like obsidian, potions, and tools
* Keep collecting resources to stay ahead of other teams.

## Phase 3: Shopping and Upgrading

* Use the **shop menus** in your base to purchase:
  * Blocks for bed defense
  * Weapons and armor for combat
  * Tools to break enemy blocks faster
  * Team upgrades such as heal pool, traps, sharpness, protection, and haste

## Phase 4: Defending the Bed

* Protect your bed with layered blocks.
* Different blocks provide different levels of defense:
  * Wool: cheap but weak
  * Wood: better for early defense
  * Stone/Endstone: harder to break
  * Obsidian: strongest, requires emeralds
* Combining different block types makes it harder for attackers to break through.

## Phase 5: Attacking and Destroying Beds

* To destroy an enemy bed:
  1. Travel to the enemy base
  2. Equip the correct tool from your inventory
  3. Use the **Pet button** to break blocks and the bed
* Beds can be destroyed with any item, but proper tools speed it up
* After destroying a bed, eliminate the remaining team members to remove them permanently

## Phase 6: Final Battles

* As beds are destroyed, remaining teams start getting eliminated
* Stay upgraded, communicate with teammates, and push when enemies are weak
* The game ends when only one team remains
