## Role Description

The **Starspawn** is a Neutral Pariah role. It possesses two distinct abilities: **Isolate** (used during the round) and **Daybreak** (used during a meeting).

- **Isolate:** The Starspawn may isolate a player using their kill button. Isolated players cannot be interacted with, unless the player attempting the interaction is not a Crewmate.
- **Daybreak:** The Starspawn may call daybreak during a meeting, notifying everyone and stopping players from using meeting abilities (such as guessing).
