## Role Description

The **Auditor** is a Neutral Pariah role that can switch between Auditing and Smokebombing modes. While in both modes, using the action reveals the target's role to the Auditor.

- **Auditing:** This action, in addition to revealing the role, either takes one ability use or all ability uses from your target.
- **Smokebombing:** This action, in addition to revealing the role, temporarily lowers the target's vision.
