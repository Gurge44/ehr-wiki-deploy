## Role Description

The **Magistrate** is a Neutral Pariah role that may call court once per game during a meeting. When court is called, every other player's name is temporarily set to **"Jury"** and the Magistrate's name is set to **"Court"**.

During this time, everyone's avatar in the chat is shown as grey with no accessories, and the Magistrate gains extra votes, giving them significant voting power during the Court session.
