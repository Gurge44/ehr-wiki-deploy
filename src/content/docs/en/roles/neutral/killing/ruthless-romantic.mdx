## Role Description

The **Ruthless Romantic** is a Neutral Killing role. This role cannot be obtained by any regular means, but is only possible to get by being the [**Romantic**](../../benign/romantic) and having your partner die under specific role conditions. The Ruthless Romantic is a regular killer, and must be the last player standing. If they win, their partner wins along with them.

## Role Options
