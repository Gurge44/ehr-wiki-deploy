## Role Description

The **Investor** is a Neutral Benign role. The Investor can use the kill button to mark a player. The Investor wins with the winning team if a percentage or more of all marked players win. If the Investor only marks 1 player, they will win regardless of the set percentage, acting as a [**Follower**](../../benign/follower). The percentage is configured in settings.
