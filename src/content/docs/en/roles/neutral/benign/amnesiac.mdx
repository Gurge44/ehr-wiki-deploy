## Role Description

The **Amnesiac** is a Neutral Benign role that can use its report button on a player's dead body to copy their role. Optionally (in settings), the Amnesiac may have to use the kill button on an alive player to copy their role, instead of the report button. The Amnesiac may also remember player add-ons if configured to do so. The Amnesiac is also considered the base Neutral role, as erasing any other Neutral role will make that role become Amnesiac.
