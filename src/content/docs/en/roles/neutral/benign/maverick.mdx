## Role Description

The **Maverick** is a Neutral Benign role. However, it is able to kill. It is one of the only roles with this property. The Maverick must survive until the end of the game, and must also kill a certain amount of players configured in settings. If both of these requirements are met, the Maverick wins with the winning team.
