## Role Description

The **Follower** is a Neutral Benign role. When the Follower uses its kill button, it will follow the target. The target may or may not know about this. The target of the Follower will have an orange diamond next to their name, only visible to the Follower. If the target knows the Follower (configurable via options), the target will see an orange diamond next to the name of the Follower, only visible to the target. The Follower wins with its target. When the Follower uses its ability on a different target while already having a target, the Follower will stop following the original target and begin following the new target.
