## Role Description

The **Tank** is a Neutral Benign role. The Tank has lower movement speed than other players, and may be immune to being killed and/or guessed (configurable in Role Options). The Tank must enter every vent available on the map to satisfy their win condition and win with the winning team. This means they must **enter** every unique vent location in the game; merely exiting through one does not progress the Tank's win condition.
