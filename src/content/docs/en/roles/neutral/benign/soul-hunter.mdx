## Role Description

The **Soul Hunter** is a Neutral Benign role. **It possesses a unique killing ability, making it one of the few Benign roles capable of eliminating other players.**

The Soul Hunter can mark a player using the kill button. In the next meeting, the marked player will be notified. Following the meeting, the Soul Hunter will be unable to move (frozen) for a configurable amount of seconds. After being unfrozen, the Soul Hunter must kill their target within a specified time limit.

* If successful, the Soul Hunter **gains a soul**.
* If they fail to kill the target in time, they **lose a soul**.

During this kill period, the marked player is restricted: they cannot kill, call a meeting, or kill the Soul Hunter.

The Soul Hunter must reach a certain amount of souls by the end of the game to win with the winning team. The amount of souls the Soul Hunter has cannot go below zero. The Soul Hunter also loses a soul if the marked player dies by anything other than the Soul Hunter in the allowed killing time, unless configured otherwise.
