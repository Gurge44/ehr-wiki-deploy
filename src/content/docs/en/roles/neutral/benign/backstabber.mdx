## Role Description

The **Backstabber** is a Neutral Benign role. Despite having the Benign alignment, it is able to kill. It is one of the only roles with this property. The Backstabber is only able to perform a single kill each game, and their win condition changes according to the target of their kill.

* If the Backstabber were to **not kill anyone**, their win condition is to win with the **Crewmates**.
* If the Backstabber kills an **Impostor** or a **Madmate**, their win condition is to win with the **winning Neutral Killer**.
* If the Backstabber kills a **Neutral** or **Coven** role, their win condition is to win with the **Impostors**.
