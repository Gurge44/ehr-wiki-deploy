## Role Description

The **Backstabber** is a Neutral Benign role. **It possesses a unique killing ability, making it one of the few Benign roles capable of eliminating other players.** The Backstabber is limited to a single kill per game, and this singular action critically determines its final win condition.

* If the Backstabber were to **not kill anyone**, their win condition is to win with the **Crewmates**.
* If the Backstabber kills an **Impostor** or a **Madmate**, their win condition is to win with the **winning Neutral Killer**.
* If the Backstabber kills a **Neutral** or **Coven** role, their win condition is to win with the **Impostors**.
