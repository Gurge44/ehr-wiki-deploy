## Role Description

The **Postman** is a Neutral Benign role. The Postman can use the kill button to deliver mail. This does not have an effect on the target. The Postman will always have a target, and they can only deliver mail to that target. Attempting to deliver mail to a different person will cause the Postman to die, with the death reason **Suicide**.

When the Postman delivers mail to all alive players, the Postman wins with the winning team. The Postman gets a new target when the current target dies. However, the Postman may die if their current target dies if configured to do so.
