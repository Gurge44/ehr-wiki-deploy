## Role Description

The **Pawn** is a Neutral Benign role. After the Pawn finishes its tasks, in meetings, the Pawn can use the command `/choose (role)`, replacing the `(role)` term with the name of the role it wants to become. After the meeting ends, the Pawn's role will be changed to the chosen role. The Pawn's role change doesn't occur until after the meeting, meaning it can use `/choose` multiple times in a meeting if it wishes to change its chosen role. It is also important to note that the Pawn can only choose roles from the ones enabled. Role skills that happen on task completion, like [**Snitch**](../../../crewmate/investigative/snitch), [**Speedrunner**](../../../crewmate/miscellaneous/speedrunner), or [**Hypocrite**](../../../crewmate/miscellaneous/hypocrite) do **not** trigger when the Pawn changes into roles that have them.
