## Role Description

The **Predator** is a Neutral Benign role (one of the only to have the ability to kill) that gets 3 target roles (**Prey**) at the start of the game. They must kill at least one of their prey roles to win with the winning team at the end. If they kill a non-prey target, the Predator commits suicide.
