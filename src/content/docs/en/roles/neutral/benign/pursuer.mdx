## Role Description

The **Pursuer** is a Neutral Benign role. The Pursuer can use their kill button on a target. The next time that target attempts to kill, a shield animation will be played on their body, and their kill cooldown will be reset, effectively causing their kill attempt to fail. The Pursuer wins with the winning team if they survive until the end of the game. There is a limit to how many times the Pursuer can use their ability. Some roles can become Pursuer in specific cases.
