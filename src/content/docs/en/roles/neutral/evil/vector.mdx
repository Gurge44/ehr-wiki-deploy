## Role Description

The **Vector** is a Neutral Evil role. The Vector must Vent a certain amount of times to win the game alone. Only **Entering** a vent progresses the Vector's win condition, meaning exiting does not. The amount of times the Vector must vent may differ between each map, as configured in the role options.
