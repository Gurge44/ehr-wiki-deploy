## Role Description

The **Executioner** is a Neutral Evil role. Their goal is simple: get their designated target ejected to win. After their target is voted out, a message saying **"But they were also the Executioner's target!"** will appear, signifying the Executioner's immediate win.

Additionally, the Executioner may win alongside the Jester and Innocent if their win conditions align (configurable via settings).
