## Role Description

The **Terrorist** is a Neutral Evil role. The Terrorist must complete all their tasks, **then** die. This order cannot be reversed. If both of these requirements are met, the Terrorist will cause all other players to die, with the death reason **Exploded**, and the Terrorist will win alone.

Due to the Terrorist causing all players to die, it can override win conditions for other roles like, [**Collector**](../../evil/collector), [**Executioner**](../../evil/executioner), and [**God**](../../evil/god).
