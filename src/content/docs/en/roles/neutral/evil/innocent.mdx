## Role Description

The **Innocent** is a Neutral Evil role that uses their kill button to frame a player. The Innocent then immediately dies, ensuring the framed target is blamed for the kill. If the framed target is subsequently ejected in a meeting, the Innocent wins the game.

The Innocent can win together with: [**Jester**](../../evil/jester) and [**Executioner**](../../evil/executioner).
