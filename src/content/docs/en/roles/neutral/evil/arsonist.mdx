## Role Description

The **Arsonist** is a Neutral Evil role. The Arsonist can use the kill button to begin dousing a target. The Arsonist must remain near the target for a certain duration, which is set by the host.

When the Arsonist begins dousing, an **Empty Orange Triangle** will be displayed next to the target's name. The required duration is displayed on the kill button cooldown. If the Arsonist moves away from the target during this process, the douse progress will be reset to 0. If the Arsonist successfully remains near the player for the entire duration, the target will be fully doused, and the empty triangle will be replaced with a **Full Orange Triangle** marker. After fully dousing a player, the Arsonist's cooldown will be reset to its original value.

When the Arsonist douses **all alive players**, they can use the vent or pet button to ignite and burn everyone, killing all players except the Arsonist, who wins alone. Players who die from this ability have the death reason **Burned**.

The Arsonist may also be able to ignite all currently marked players, burning them without necessarily ending the game, if configured in the options.
