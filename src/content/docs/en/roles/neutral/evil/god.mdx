## Role Description

The **God** is a Neutral Chaos role. The God can see the roles of all players, and must survive until the end of the game to win. Unlike cooperative Benign roles such as [**Opportunist**](../../benign/opportunist) or [**Pursuer**](.././benign/pursuer), the God wins **alone** if they survive until the end. Depending on the host's settings, the God might only be able to see the Factions of all players instead of the specific roles. Players may be notified during meetings if the God is still alive.

<Aside type="danger">
**Immediate Win Risk:** Enabling the God to guess in Guesser Mode while also allowing them to know players' Roles (the default setting) is not recommended, as it permits the God to guess every player's role immediately, resulting in an instant win.
