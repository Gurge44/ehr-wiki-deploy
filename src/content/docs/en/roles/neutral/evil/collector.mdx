## Role Description

The **Collector** is a Neutral Evil role. When the Collector votes for a player, they gain a number of points equal to how many players voted that player. This amount also includes the Collector's own vote. When the Collector accumulates enough points, the Collector wins alone. The required amount of points is set by the host. The Collector may also override other win conditions like [**Jester**](../../evil/jester) or [**Executioner**](../../evil/executioner).
