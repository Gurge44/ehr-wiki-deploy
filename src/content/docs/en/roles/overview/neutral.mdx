## 🎲 What are Neutral Roles?

Neutral roles are **not aligned** with Crewmates or Impostors.  
They operate independently and have unique objectives, which can range from survival to chaos. Make sure to read the role descriptions for neutral roles carefully.

## 🏆 Win Conditions

Each neutral role has its own condition for winning.  
Most common win conditions include:

- Survive until the end of the game.
- Be killed under specific circumstances.
- Win if a certain team/role loses.
- Be the last player alive
- Cause confusion or sabotage both teams.

:::note
Some neutral roles can win **alongside** either team if their condition is met.

## 🍬 What are the kinds of Neutral Roles?

Neutral roles have **4** Alignments, each with their own unique gimmicks and win conditions! These alignments are:

### 😶‍🌫️ Neutral Benign

- Neutral Benign roles do not affect the winning of other teams, and usually have minimal effect on the game's course.
- Neutral Benign roles mostly win with the winning team, instead of winning alone.

### 🔪 Neutral Killing

- Neutral Killing roles have the ability to kill! Scary! They are lone killers with no teammates, with some exceptions.
- Neutral Killing roles almost always win alone by being the last person standing.

### 😈 Neutral Evil

- Neutral Evil roles cannot kill, but are powerful in their own ways, and can have a drastic effect on the game.
- Neutral Evil roles always win alone.

### 🐍 Neutral Pariah

- Neutral Pariah roles absolutely despise the crew! Their abilities mostly focus on hindering the crew's ability to win.
- Unsurprisingly, all Neutral Pariah roles win with the winning team as long as the Crewmates lose.
