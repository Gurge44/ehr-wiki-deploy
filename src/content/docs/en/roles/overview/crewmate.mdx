Crewmates are the **core team** in Among Us.  

Their goal is to <u>complete all tasks</u> or <u>identify and eject all [impostors](../impostor) and hostile [neutrals](../neutral)</u>. Crewmates win as a team, even if they die.

EHR adds a wide variety of unique crewmate roles to help accomplish this, each with their own abilities and specialities. Some roles are passive (like [Analyst](../crewmate/investigative/analyst)), while others are active (like [Sheriff](../crewmate/killing/sheriff)). Add more crewmate roles to increase **team variety and survivability**.
