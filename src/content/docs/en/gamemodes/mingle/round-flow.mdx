Mingle follows a repeating cycle of movement, room selection, and elimination.  
Every round becomes faster or more unpredictable as the player count drops.

---

## 🔹 Start of the Round

At the beginning of each round:
- The HUD displays the **valid rooms** chosen for that round.
- Each room shows the **required number of players**.
- A **timer** starts counting down.

This is the signal to start moving immediately.

---

## 🔹 Movement Phase

During this phase:
- All living players move through the map toward the room they want.
- Players can switch rooms at any time before the timer ends.
- Crowding, hesitation, or misreading the HUD can lead to elimination.

Only your final location when the timer ends matters.

---

## 🔹 Timer End

When the timer reaches zero, the following happens instantly:
- Players in **invalid rooms** are eliminated.
- Players in valid rooms but with the **wrong number of occupants** are eliminated.
- Players meeting the requirement survive and continue to the next round.

There are no second chances.

---

## 🔹 New Round

After the elimination:
- New rooms are selected.
- New player counts are assigned.
- The next timer begins.

This loop repeats until one player remains.
