Mingle revolves around moving to the correct room before the timer ends.  
Every round selects a set of rooms and assigns each of them a required number of players.

## 🔹 How Rooms Work

- Each round chooses **specific rooms** as valid rooms.
- Each chosen room has a **required player count**.
- If you enter a room that is not selected for the round, you are eliminated when the timer ends.
- If you are in a selected room but the number of players is not correct, you are also eliminated.

---

## 🔹 Entering Rooms

When the round begins:
1. Look at the **round HUD** to see which rooms are valid.
2. Move toward any valid room before the timer expires.
3. Once inside, make sure the number of players matches the requirement.

Being even one player above or below the required number results in elimination.

## 🔹 Room Randomization

Each round:
- The **set of valid rooms** is randomized.
- The **required player amounts** change.
- The **timer duration** may vary depending on round difficulty.

This makes every round unpredictable and forces fast decision making.

:::tip
Watch how many people are entering your room. If a room fills too quickly, move to another before the timer ends to avoid sudden eliminations.
