The Mingle HUD gives you all the information you need to survive each round.  
Reading it quickly and correctly is the difference between staying alive and getting eliminated.

## 🔹 Room Indicators

At the top of the screen, you will see a list of **valid rooms** for the current round.  
Each room indicator shows:

- **Room Name**  
  The room you must enter if you choose that option.

- **Required Player Count**  
  The exact number of players that must be inside that room when the timer ends.

- **Current Player Count**  
  Updates in real time as players move around the map.

This lets you know whether a room is filling too fast or too slowly.

## 🔹 HUD Symbols

These are the symbols shown in the Mingle HUD and what they represent:

- __ (Underlined)
  Marks the room you are currently inside.

- ＋
  Your room has more players than required.

- －
  Your room has fewer players than required.

- ＝
  Your room has the correct number of players.

- ✓
  A green check that appears when a room is perfectly matched.

- ╳
  A red cross used when a room is unsafe or incorrect.

- ⚠
  Shows when you are not in any required room.

## 🔹 Color Coding

Rooms use simple colors to show their current state:

- **Green** → The room currently meets the required number of players.  
- **Yellow** → The room does not yet have the required number of players.  
- **Red** → The room has too many players and someone will be eliminated unless some leave.

Use these colors to make quick decisions.

## 🔹 Round Timer

A large countdown timer appears in the center or top of your HUD.  
When it reaches zero:

- All checks stop.
- The game locks your position.
- Eliminations happen instantly.

Once the timer is below **3 seconds**, it becomes much harder to switch rooms safely.

---

## 🔹 Audio Cues

Mingle also uses audio cues to help you respond quickly:

- A short **beep** plays when a new round starts.  
- A more urgent **warning sound** plays when the timer is low.

These cues help you react even when you are not looking directly at the HUD.
