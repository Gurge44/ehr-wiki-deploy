Time management is the core of the Mingle gamemode.  
Every round is driven by a countdown that determines when room checks and eliminations happen. Understanding how the timer works helps you predict the pace of the game and react correctly.

---

## 🔹 Base Round Time
At the start of a match, the game sets the initial timer using the **Time Limit** option.  
This value determines how long the first round lasts.

---

## 🔹 Extra Time on Certain Maps
Some maps provide bonus time at the start of the match based on the settings:

- **Airship** gives additional starting seconds  
- **Fungle** gives additional starting seconds  

This extra time is added only once and does not repeat after each round.

---

## 🔹 Time Decrease When There Are No Deaths
If a round ends with everyone surviving, the next round becomes shorter.  
The amount of reduction is determined by the **Time Decrease On No Death** option.

This creates increasing pressure and speeds up the pace until players start getting eliminated again.

---

## 🔹 Minimum Time Limit
The round timer will never go below the value set by **Minimum Time**.  
Even if many rounds have no eliminations, the countdown will stop decreasing once it reaches this limit.

---

## 🔹 When the Timer Reaches Zero
When the countdown reaches zero, the game immediately performs a room check:

- Are you in a required room  
- Are you in a room with the correct number of players  
- Are you not outside or in a restricted room  
- Are you alive and active  

Anyone who fails these checks is eliminated.  
After this phase, a new round begins with freshly generated room requirements.
