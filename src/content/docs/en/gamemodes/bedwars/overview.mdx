Bed Wars in **Endless Host Roles** is a **team-based survival gamemode** inspired by Minecraft’s [Hypixel Bed Wars](https://hypixel.net/bed-wars).  
Your goal: **protect your bed, destroy enemy beds, and eliminate all opposing teams**.  
Once a team’s bed is destroyed, players on that team **cannot respawn after dying**.
